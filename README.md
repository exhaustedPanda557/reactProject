# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to help a user manage their fridge and select dinner that takes into account a balanced diet and food waste. Users can filter by a food's status (filter to just expiring soon) to make sure that they are using items that are expiring soon. Additionally, a user can filter by food category (filter to just fruits/vegetables) to help users easily find the vegetables. Lastly, users can sort by calories to help users make healthy choices about ingredients. 

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
