# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to help a user manage their fridge and select dinner that takes into account a balanced diet and food waste. Users can filter by a food's status to make sure that they are using items that are expiring soon. Additionally, a user can filter by food category to make sure that their meal consists of all the food groups (it helps them easily find the vegetables!). Lastly, users can sort by calories to help users make healthy choices about ingredients. 

### Usability Principles Considered
